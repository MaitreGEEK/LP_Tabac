# 🌿 LP-TABAC

**LP-TABAC** is a complete **QBX Core** job script that allows players to harvest, process, and sell tobacco in an immersive way on your FiveM server.  

It uses **ox_target** and **ox_lib** for all interactions, and handles dynamic spawning/despawning of tobacco plants across predefined fields.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🌱 **Dynamic harvesting** – Random plant spawns within predefined fields  
- 🔄 **Automatic respawn** – Plants respawn once the field is fully harvested  
- 🏭 **Processing** – Convert harvested tobacco into cigarettes  
- 💰 **Selling** – Sell cigarettes to a ped or at a dedicated selling zone  
- 🔒 Harvest anti-spam using an `isHarvesting` flag  
- 🎯 Uses **ox_target** for all interactions  
- 📍 Configurable **processing**, **selling** zones, and **map blips**  
- 👷 **Job-restricted** interactions (only tobacco workers can see plants & zones)
